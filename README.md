# MCHEmploymentSamples

For years, I made my students upload sample projects to GitHub. Since I'm back in the job market, it makes sense to do the same thing myself.


## Getting started

Material is separated into folders for review:

* *Code/* MCH small code samples, both from course material and programs for personal use.

* *Labs/* Lab documents to give a sense of MCH's lab style, a combination of Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TiLT) and Universal Design (UD).

* *Lectures/* PowerPoints to give a sense of MCH's lecture style.


### Where to start

* *Lectures/Mental Models.pptx* describes how people make sense of the things they use.

* *Labs/JavaScript W7 Idle Clicker Game.html* runs in any web browser and is fun for a few minutes.

* *Code/Create-Subtitles* is how I solved the problem of creating subtitles for every saved movie on my computer.


### How to use

The "Labs/JavaScript W7 Idle Clicker Game" can be opened in any web browser. Students really liked expanding this one as part of a weekly assignment.

"Labs/VueJS W04 VueJs3-Props-and-events" page can be opened in any web browser.

The "CodeJavaScript traverse XML nodes" folder should be opened using File -> Open -> Web Site . . . in Visual Studio Enterprise on Windows.

The "Methods Console App Lecture Demo" was created and tested in Visual Studio Enterprise on Windows. It should work in Visual Studio Community. I have not tested it in Visual Studio Code.
